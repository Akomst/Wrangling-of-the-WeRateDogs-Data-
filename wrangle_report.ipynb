    "#### Data Gathering\n",
    "Wrangling starts with the collection of data, and in this project, three sets of data were collected from different sources.\n",
    " The \"WeRateDogs Twitter archive\" and \"Tweet Image Prediction\" datasets were downloaded to the workspace manually and Â using request library respectively. Both datasets were provided by Udacity. \n",
    " Additional data was collected as \"tweet_json.txt\" using Tweepy library to request Twitter posts with user ids present \"Tweet Image Prediction\". From this data, a csv file, that includes user_id, favorite_count and retweet_count, was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessing Data\n",
    "From these datasets, 8 quality and tidiness issues that requires cleaning were identified. Much of these issues are associated with the archive data and these includes: incorrect values for some observations, wrong datatypes, sparse values in some features and tweets without images in the prediction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning Data\n",
    "The identified tidiness and quality issues were cleaned under this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the cleaned datasets were merged to for a master dataset to be used for insights \n",
